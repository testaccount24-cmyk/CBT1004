//***FILE1004 is a tape mapping program called PRECIS from the      *   FILE1004
//*           University of North Carolina (a very old program).    *   FILE1004
//*           It still works, and its output is very useful,        *   FILE1004
//*           since it prints the beginning of each data block on   *   FILE1004
//*           the tape (hex display for 80 bytes), for the first    *   FILE1004
//*           10 blocks (which can be changed by the 4th parm).     *   FILE1004
//*                                                                 *   FILE1004
//*           Reed Starnes has improved this program significantly. *   FILE1004
//*           Since we now have program source from Reed Starnes,   *   FILE1004
//*           we have eliminated the old versions of the PRECIS     *   FILE1004
//*           program from this file, to avoid confusion.           *   FILE1004
//*                                                                 *   FILE1004

//*           This being an old program, the tape block size is     *   FILE1004
//*           (currently) limited to 32760 bytes.  BSAM I/O.        *   FILE1004
//*           It is possible that the original version of this      *   FILE1004
//*           program may be as old as 1968.  But even the          *   FILE1004
//*           original version still worked fine.                   *   FILE1004
//*                                                                 *   FILE1004
//*           The program source (member PRECIS) was fixed to       *   FILE1004
//*           accommodate larger tapes that have thousands of       *   FILE1004
//*           tape marks.                                           *   FILE1004

//*           You can now control the maximum number of data        *   FILE1004
//*           blocks to be printed for each file, by setting        *   FILE1004
